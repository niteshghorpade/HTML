## Difference in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

Lets consider a web page as a human body. Now let's see what each of these language really do:

HTML is a structural language that build the structure of a website as the skeletal system form the structure of the human body. Heading, paragraphs, images, text all are the part of HTML that creates the basic structure of a website.

CSS is a styling language that gives styling of a website. With the help of front color, background color and border styling CSS furnishes the look of the site as the skin gives look to the human body.
